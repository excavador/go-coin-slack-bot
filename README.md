## Inspired by [rapidloop/mybot](https://github.com/rapidloop/mybot)

A simple [Slack](https://slack.com) bot that reads the current state of the cryptocurrencies from [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com)

### Supported commands:

* `coin <symbol>` - return the stats for the provided coin
* `rank <N>` - list top N currencies, sorted by price (results are surprising)

### Usage

`./slack_coins <token from slack>`
